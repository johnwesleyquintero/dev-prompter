# Project Objectives and Requirements

## Primary Objective
   -Objective: Build/Refactor the codebase to a production-ready state in pure TypeScript, eliminating dependencies and incompatibility issues. Achieve zero-defect tolerance, complete feature parity, and superior performance.

## Key Requirements

1. **TypeScript Implementation**
   - Build with all code as pure TypeScript (Convert if possible)
   - Ensure type safety across the codebase

2. **Code Quality & Performance**
   - Achieve zero known defects
   - Exceed performance benchmarks
   - Simplify configuration for main branch integration

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Implement comprehensive testing suite:
     - Unit testing
     - Integration testing
     - End-to-end testing
     - Performance testing
     - Security testing
     - Usability testing
   - Maintain 100% code coverage

4. **Development Standards**
   - Ensure code maintainability and scalability
   - Adhere to established coding standards
   - Maintain backward compatibility

5. **Infrastructure & Deployment**
   - Implement robust CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure automated testing and rollback capabilities
   - Set up monitoring and alerting systems
   - Ensure production deployment readiness

6. **Documentation & Security**
   - Create comprehensive user documentation
   - Conduct thorough security testing and vulnerability scanning

## Expected Outcome
Deliver a robust, performant, secure, and maintainable codebase that is ready for production deployment.
